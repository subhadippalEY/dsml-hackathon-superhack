Case Study:

Imagine you are a lead data scientist in charge of a critical project within your organization. The project involves developing a complex software system that is integral to the success of a new product launch. As the project progresses, there is a growing concern about the overall quality of the software codebase, and management has decided to conduct a thorough software quality assessment. The development team has been diligently working on project, and the codebase has evolved over time. However, as the project is reaching a crucial milestone, there is a need to ensure that the software meets the highest quality standards to minimize the risk of defects and ensure long-term maintainability. To initiate the software quality assessment, the team has gathered a dataset containing various metrics related to the software's complexity, size, structure, and potential defects. Your task as the lead data scientist is to leverage this dataset to perform a comprehensive software quality assessment. The goal is to analyze the provided metrics and identify key insights regarding the overall quality of the software. Your findings will be crucial in making informed decisions about areas that need improvement, potential risks, and the overall health of the software codebase
